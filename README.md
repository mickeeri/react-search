This is a Single Page Application with a faked faked backend. The app is developed with
React, Redux, babel and more. It uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
for configuration.

#### Development
1. Requires node.js and npm.
2. From the project root, run `npm install`.
3. Then use `npm start` to open the application in a web browser.

#### Deployment
The command `npm run build` creates production optimized files that ends up in the folder `/build`.

For more details on deployment, see [create-react-app documentation] (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment).
